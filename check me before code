  basically im running in bushes holding a or s or anything and keep repeating until i encounter a pokemon , how computer knows when a pokemon appears ?
so whenever a pokemon appears there is battle menu in ur screen stating "run", fight,etc
  im taking screenshot of the place where menu appears every sec and comparing it to the screenshot i have of battle menu if both match means battle appeard
now next stage is checking if the pokemon is "epic" or comon so for exWhat am I doing? 

Basically, I'm running through the bushes while holding the 'A' or 'S' key, and I keep repeating this until I encounter a Pokémon. How does the computer know when a Pokémon has appeared? 

Whenever a Pokémon shows up, a battle menu appears on your screen with options like "Run," "Fight," etc. I'm taking a screenshot of the area where the menu appears every second and comparing it to the screenshot I have of the battle menu. If both match, it means a battle has started.

The next stage is checking whether the Pokémon is "epic" or "common." For example, i am looking for a charmander which is rare so i found a chartmander manually and screenshot it , whenever the battle starts im comparing screenshot of the area of pokemon wd the screenshot of my pokemon in this case charmander
  if they matches send an alert via pyautogui.alert
  else 
  run away wd pyautogui.moveTo and pyautogui.click
  and repeat the process again and again until it find another charmander i could have made it catch charmander or add ev training or level up training 
means the potential this program has is very big 
enjoy : )
btw my monitor is 16.4 inches and 1920*1080
  so if u dont have same size and resolution u need to check for particular coordinates of certain button in ur screen dw i will give u  a code to find that too
